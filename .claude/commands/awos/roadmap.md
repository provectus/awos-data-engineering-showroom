Notes:
1. We are taking over already existing project which has v1 implemented. To better understand what we have go over code and analyze it. Remember working pieces are dbt in dbt directory, dlt_pipeline, airflow and streamlit_app. For this point ignore data_quality and notebooks.  
2. We will have several roadmaps for different quarters, to name roadmap file correctly and understand about which roadmap we are talking about always ask for quarters
4. Look at README.md for more info
5. At begining ask for roadmap/quarter goals and ask any clarifying question that you need to better fill templates 

Refer to the instructions located in this file: .awos/commands/roadmap.md
