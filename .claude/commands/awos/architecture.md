Make sure:
1. We are taking over already existing project which has v1 implemented. To better understand what we have go over code and analyze it. Remember working pieces are dbt, dlt_pipeline, airflow and streamlit_app each in separate folder. We would like to follow same logic, approach and tech stack for the rest of features. Our goal is to keep changes small enouge that it will be easier to mentain. The code that is already working shoudn't be updated unless of real need. 
2. Defines the System Architecture, technology stack, databases, infrastructure similar the one we are already using
4. Look at README.md for more info
5. Ask any clarifying question that you need to better fill templates
