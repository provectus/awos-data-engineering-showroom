description: Creates the Technical Spec — how the feature will be built.
---

Make sure to:
1. Give clarifying questions
2. Go over feature to feature to better detail them and understand the sequence of implementation 
3. We are taking over already existing project which has v1 implemented. To better understand it we have to go over code and analyze it. Remember working pieces are dbt, dlt_pipeline, airflow and streamlit_app each in separate folder. We would like to follow same logic, approach and tech stack for the rest of features. Our goal is to keep changes small enouge that it will be easier to mentain. The code that is already working shoudn't be updated unless of real need. 
4. Run any api and check that needed to creat paln as correctly and close to real life as possible.
